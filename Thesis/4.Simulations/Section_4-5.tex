    On one hand, on the current resolution the gas drag is considerably underestimated. On the other hand, the gravitational interactions of the mass stream with the inner binary seems to act like a scattering process, but in favor of the stars. 



Finally, it is important to mention that after analyzing my data, it became clear that the resolution of my simulations was insufficient to accurately capture the influence of the gas drag on the inner orbit. As a result, the gas drag is underestimated, while the models capture the gravitational interactions between the inner binary, the core of the tertiary, and its gaseous envelope.  A detailed discussion over the low resolution and the gas drag is provided in \cref{discussion}.
