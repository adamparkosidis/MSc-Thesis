In this chapter, I present the results of the simulations listed in \cref{tab:simulations_settings}. First I I discuss model number 1 and highlight some points that are similar for all models. In \cref{sec:resolution}, I speculate over the simulations' resolution and its effect on the simulations' outcome. In the next section, I explicitly compare models 1 and 4, to investigate the effect of the accretion, see \cref{sec:goal}. Finally, in the last section, I compare models 1, 2 and 3 to examine the effect of the initial mutual inclination between the two orbits, see \cref{sec:goal}.

At the beginning of the simulations, the star's envelope is spherical and gravitationally bound to the star. In all simulations, the outer layers of the tertiary's envelope are dragged towards the $L_1$ point at every pericenter passage.  Because, particles can escape from the gravitational well of the tertiary and later captured again, it is not trivial to define which particles are part of the star at every time step, see \cref{fig:simualtion_snapshots}. Based on the definition of the Roche lobe, see \cref{sub:roche_lobe}, I consider at each time step all the particles inside that $R_L$ to be part of the star and contribute to its total mass. Furthermore, the size of Roche lobe itself change periodically due to the motion of the giant relatively to the inner binary's center of mass, see \cref{eq:roche_lobe}. As a result, the aforementioned periodicity is intrinsically carried through the evolution of the tertiary's mass too, see \cref{fig:accretion_tertiary_mass}.


In conclusion, periodic variations are naturally integrated in my models. The orbit is eccentric, the envelope is distorted as a result of tidal interactions with the inner orbit, and its mass fluctuates as matter surpasses and returns inside its Roche lobe. Disentangling these different factors is not trivial and their combined effect is carried through all calculations and thus it is evident in all plots displaying orbital parameters and properties of the outer orbit, e.g. see \cref{fig:accretion_outer_semimajor_axis} and \cref{fig:accretion_tertiary_mass}. The key point though, is that the aforementioned features are obviously strongly correlated with the tertiary's orbit and thus it is not a surprise that the timescale of this combined periodicity is equal to the period of the outer orbit. 

In this work, I am interested in the global evolution of the orbital parameters. As a result, in the next sections, the presented graphs associated with the outer orbit, display not only the original output of my simulations, but also smoothed versions of it with a width equal to $3 \times P_{out}$. The is for illustration purposes, as it is easier for the reader to follow the comparison between the cases listed in \cref{tab:simulations_settings}. Furthermore, because no significant mass is transferred during the first four years of the simulations. The rates of change of orbital parameters are primarily determined by tidal effects between the two orbits. In all simulations, mass transfer from the tertiary to the inner binary begins at $t \approx 4$ yr, so the time period of interest in my work begins at that point.

Finally, it is important to mention that after analyzing my data, it became clear that the resolution of my simulations was insufficient to accurately capture the influence of the gas drag on the inner orbit. As a result, the gas drag is underestimated, while the models capture the gravitational interactions between the inner binary, the core of the tertiary, and its gaseous envelope. Regardless, I can still extract useful information about the evolution of the outer orbit and conjecture about the evolution of the inner orbit. A detailed discussion over the low resolution and the gas drag is provided in \cref{discussion}.
