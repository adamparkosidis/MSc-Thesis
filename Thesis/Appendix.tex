\chapter*{Appendix}

The are a few ways to numerically approximate derivatives of functions and central differentiation is the most accurate one. My goal is to estimate the slope of a curve $f$ at a certain location $x = a$ using $f(a)$ and the value of $f$ at a neighboring point $x = a + h$. If $h$ is small enough, the shorter broken line in Figure 11 can be regarded of as an acceptable approximation to the requisite slope (indicated by the longer broken line).
