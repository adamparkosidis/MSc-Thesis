The evolution of outer Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) triple-star systems is influenced by various physical processes, including stellar evolution, gravitational dynamics, and hydrodynamics. I utilize the Astrophysical Multi-purpose Software Environment (AMUSE, \cite{portegies2018astrophysical}), a comprehensive computational tool, to accurately simulate and solve for these physical processes in a self-consistent manner. To model the evolution of the system star prior to outer stars's RLOF, I employed a stellar evolution code (MESA, \cite{paxton2010modules,paxton2013modules,paxton2015modules,paxton2019modules}). Once the outer star reached the stage where it approximately filled its Roche lobe, I pause the stellar evolution simulation and converted the one-dimensional stellar structure into a three-dimensional hydrodynamical model. This hydrodynamical model of the outer star is then relaxed and placed in orbit around the binary star. Subsequently, I monitor the intricate hydrodynamics of the mass transfer from the Roche lobe-filling outer star to the inner binary for multiple orbits, while simultaneously keeping track of the gravitational dynamics of the three stars and the hydrodynamics of the gas from the outer star. A schematic representation of the entire process is provided in
