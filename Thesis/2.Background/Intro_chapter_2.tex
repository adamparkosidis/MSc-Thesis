The evolution of a star in isolation, namely single star evolution, is predominantly determined by the stellar mass. Stars with $M \leq 2$ M$_{\odot}$, $2 < M \leq 8$ M$_{\odot}$ and $M > 8$ M$_{\odot}$ are classified as low-, intermediate-, and high-mass, respectively. In their attempt to achieve \ac{he} and \ac{te}, stars generate temperatures and pressures that allow for nuclear burning. The cycles of nuclear burning and fuel exhaustion regulate the evolution of a star and set the various phases during the stellar lifetime. These burning cycles can be viewed as long-lived, but transient disruptions to a star's (or at least its core's) inexorable shrinkage under the effect of gravity. The virial theorem dictates, that this contraction is caused by the fact that stars are hot and lose energy through radiation.
