\section{Evolution of Intermediate-mass Stars in Isolation}\label{sec:single_star_evolution}

The evolution of a star in isolation, namely single star evolution, is predominantly determined by the stellar mass. Stars with $M \leq 2$ M$_{\odot}$, $2 < M \leq 8$ M$_{\odot}$ and $M > 8$ M$_{\odot}$ are classified as low-, intermediate-, and high-mass, respectively. In their attempt to achieve hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium, stars generate temperatures and pressures that allow for nuclear burning. The cycles of nuclear burning and fuel exhaustion regulate the evolution of a star and set the various phases during the stellar lifetime. These burning cycles can be viewed as long-lived, but transient disruptions to a star's (or at least its core's) inexorable shrinkage under the effect of gravity. The virial theorem dictates this contraction is caused by the fact that stars are hot and lose energy through radiation. 

Intermediate-mass stars have a complex evolutionary path that includes multiple phases of fusion and contraction. The late stages of their evolution, namely the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, is characterized by rich nucleosynthesis and strong mass loss, that eventually removes their envelopes, leaving behind a degenerate C-O core as the central star of a planetary nebula\citep{pols2011stellar}. Additionally, the lost mass provides material for future generations of stars, hence understanding the nature and history of intermediate-mass stars is critical for investigating chemical enrichment and energy generation in galaxies, as well as forecasting the fate of stars like our sun. Furthermore, AGB stars dominate the integral luminosity of intermediate-age stellar systems. As a result, they may be used to examine extra-galactic populations\citep{marigo2007evolution}.


\begin{comment}
 Despite the inherent rarity predicted by the initial mass function (IMF, see e.g. \cite{chabrier2005initial, dib2018emergence}), massive stars play a key role in the evolution of the Universe. They are the main source of UV radiation and heavy elements. They serve as a significant source of mixing and turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies through a combination of winds, outflows, expanding HII regions, and supernova explosions. Galactic dynamos are powered by turbulence in conjunction with differential rotation. Cosmic rays are accelerated by the interaction of galactic magnetic fields and supernova shock fronts. The ISM is primarily heated by cosmic rays, UV radiation, and the dissipation of turbulence, whereas it is finally cooled by heavy metals present in dust, molecules, and in atomic/ionic form. Therefore, massive stars have a significant impact on galaxies' physical, chemical, and morphological structure \citep{kennicutt2005role}. However, the physical mechanisms behind the birth, development, and demise of massive stars remain elusive in comparison with low-mass stars \citep{zinnecker2007toward}.

\subsection{Timescales of Stellar Evolution}\label{subsec:timescales}

The fundamental timescales of stellar evolution are the dynamical ($t_{dyn}$), thermal ($t_{th}$), and nuclear timescales ($t_{nucl}$). The dynamical timescale is the characteristic time required for a star to collapse under its own gravitational force in the absence of internal pressure:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dynamical_timsecale}
    t_{dyn} = \sqrt{\frac{R^3}{GM}} \sim 0.02 \left( \frac{R}{R_{\odot}} \right)^{3/2} \left( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{1/2} \; \text{days},
\end{equation}

where $R$ and $M$ are the star's radius and mass. It is a period on which a star might expand or contract if its hydrostatic equilibrium were disrupted, e.g. in case of sudden mass-loss.

Thermal (or Kelvin-Helmholtz) timescale indicates how quickly changes in a star's thermal structure may occur. It is therefore also the period on which a star responds when a its thermal equilibrium is disturbed:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:thermal_timsecale}
    t_{th} = \frac{G M^2}{2RL} \sim 1.5 \times 10^7 \left( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right)^{2} \frac{R_{\odot}}{R} \frac{L_{\odot}}{L} \; \text{yr},
\end{equation}

where L is the star's luminosity.

Finally, the nuclear timescale corresponds to the time required for the star to exhaust its nuclear fuel supply at its current luminosity: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:nuclear_timsecale}
    t_{nucl} = \frac{\phi M_{nucl} c^2}{L} \sim 10^{10} \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \frac{L_{\odot}}{L} \; \text{yr},,
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is the efficiency of nuclear energy production, $M_{nuc}$ is the amount of mass available as fuel, and $c$ is the light speed. For core hydrogen burning, $\phi = 0.007$ and $M_{nucl} \sim 0.1 M$.

Typically $t_{nucl} >> t_{th} >> t_{dyn}$, while assuming a mass-luminosity relation of $L \propto M^{\alpha}$, with empirically $\alpha \sim 3-4$ \citep{eker2015main}, it follows that intermediate- and high-mass stars live shorter and evolve faster than low-mass stars.

\subsection{Hertzsprung-Russell diagram}\label{sub:HR_diagram}

The Hertzsprung-Russel diagram is a logarithmic representation of the surface luminosity (or absolute magnitude) of a star as a function of its effective temperature (or spectral type). It is used to study the evolution of a star during different phases (from the pre-main sequence up to the late phases). It is divided into five different regions, namely the main-sequence, the red-giant branch, the horizontal-giant branch, the asymptotic-giant branch and the region of degenerate stars (WD).

    \caption{Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Evolutionary tracks for three stars with masses 3, 5.5 and 8 M$_{\odot}$ at solar metallicity until the end of Helium burning. Specific moments in the evolution of the stars are noted by black circles and squares as explained in the text. The tracks are calculated with MESA \citep{paxton2010modules,paxton2013modules,paxton2015modules,paxton2019modules}. The dashed lines show lines of constant radii by means of the Stefan–Boltzmann law.}
    \label{fig:HR_inter_stars}
\end{figure}
The Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram in \cref{fig:HR_inter_stars} shows three evolutionary tracks for intermediate-mass stars. The black circles correspond to the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) and the Terminal Age Main Sequence (TAMS). At ZAMS, the star having started the hydrogen burning in its core, achieves thermal equilibrium (TE), $L_{nuc}/L =1$, while TAMS is defined as the core hydrogen exhaustion point. Additionally, the black squares represent the start and end of helium burning in the core, respectively. In both cases the end of nuclear burning in the core is defined as the point when hydrogen and helium core mass fractions are $< 0.01$. The change in the star's physical radius occurs on different timescales depending on the physical mechanism buried beneath these processes. On nuclear timescale ($t_{nuc}$, see \ref{eq:nuclear_timsecale}), stars evolve throughout the main sequence (MS) and the helium-burning phase, while on thermal timescale ($t_{th}$, see \ref{eq:thermal_timsecale}), stars expand during the H-shell burning phase.

\end{figure}
Fig. \ref{fig:HR_evolution} indicates the evolution of a 5.5M$_{\odot}$ star in isolation from the beginning of the main-sequence until the end of the early ABG phase. The evolutionary track is further categorized into sections and subsections: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Main-Sequence (green)
    \item Giant branch: 
        \subitem Hertzsprung gap or subgiant branch (yellow) 
        \subitem Red giant branch (red)
    \item Blue loop (blue)
    \item Early asymptotic giant branch (black)
\end{enumerate}
During the MS, hydrogen is fused into $^4$He. Independent of the ongoing reaction channel (pp or CNO), the luminosity of the star increases during this phase, (L$\,\propto\,\mu^{4}\,M^3$), due to the change in the core's composition ($\mu$ increases). Nevertheless, the way in which a star evolves through the MS-phase depends on its mass. Stars with masses M\,$\geq$\,1.3\,M$_\odot$ are driven by the CNO-cycle ($\epsilon_{CNO}\,\propto\,\rho_{c}T^{18}_{c}$). The thermostatic action of the CNO-cycle causes the envelope to expand and, as a result, a decrease in effective temperature. Stars driven by the CNO-cycle evolve through larger radii and lower T$_{eff}$ than stars driven by the pp-cycle. Additionally, stars with masses M\,$\geq$\,1.3\,M$_\odot$ have convective cores, since the energy produced is too large to be transported by radiation ($\nabla_{rad} > \nabla_{ad}$). One effect of the convection on the evolution is that the MS-lifetime is extended (more detailed discussion in \cref{sub:mixing}). Another effect is that as the core approaches the end of H-burning, the reactions suddenly cease in the whole core, threatening the thermal equilibrium of the star. In response the temperature of the core needs to increase in order to keep the same energy generation rate leading to the contraction of the star. This is evident in the second part of the MS (see \cref{fig:HR_evolution}), where we observe the ``hook'' feature. 

At TAMS, where the hydrogen in the core has been depleted, hydrogen burning occurs in a shell around the core, while the central temperature is insufficient to initiate He-burning. From that point on, the evolution is driven by the mirror principle and stars evolve towards red giants. The core contracts on $t_{th}$ in an attempt to reach thermal equilibrium, while the envelope expands. The aforementioned behavior is evident in Fig. \ref{fig:HR_inter_stars}, as stars move towards bigger radius and lower effective temperature. Intermediate-mass stars reach effective temperatures as low as ($10^{3.7}$K) 5000K before helium ignition. At this moment, they begin to ascend the red giant branch (RGB), which is accompanied by a significant rise in luminosity and radius. Due to the low effective temperature the opacity of the envelope rises and the latter becomes gradually convective ($\nabla_{rad} \propto \frac{\kappa}{T^4}$). The prohibited zone of the HR-diagram is located to the right of the RGB, where hydrostatic equilibrium cannot be established. Any star in this zone will travel quickly towards the RGB. The red giant star has a compact core and an extensive envelope that extends hundreds of solar radii. 

When the temperature in the core exceeds $T_c \sim 10^8 K$, helium core burning begins. $^4$He fuses into a mixture of $^{12}$C and $^{16
}$O via the $triple- \alpha$ and $C+\alpha$ reactions, respectively. Helium ignition is thermally stable for intermediate-mass stars. The contraction of the core seizes, the envelope starts to contract and the stellar radius decreases on $t_{nuc}$, see \eqref{eq:nuclear_timsecale}. As the star begins to descend the red giant branch, the temperature in the envelope gradually rises. As a result, the envelope progressively shifts from convective to radiative. From the transition point on the star enters the blue loop with a helium burning core, a hydrogen burning shell, a radiative envelope, and a gradually increasing effective temperature.  Hence, the luminosity starts to rise, because it has a stronger dependence on the effective temperature than on the radius ($L \propto R^2 T_{eff}^4$). After the point where star reaches local maximum temperature, the evolution is similar with the second part of the main-sequence (``hook'' feature). Due to the convective core, the He-burning reactions suddenly cease in the whole core and not gradually. The temperature of the core ($T_c$) needs to increase in order to keep the same energy generation rate thus the pressure exerted on the core by the layers between the hydrogen burning shell and the core must also increase. This result to the decrease of the pressure that is exerted by these layers towards the hydrogen burning shell. Due to the thermostatic behavior of the CNO-cycle the pressure by the envelope towards the hydrogen burning shell must also decrease. This leads to the envelope's expansion and the reduction of the effective temperature until the end of He-burning (see Fig. \ref{fig:HR_inter_stars}).

The end of He-burning marks the beginning of the AGB phase (black part of the track in Fig. \ref{fig:HR_evolution}). This is a brief yet very important evolutionary phase of interemidiate-mass stars. It is characterized by rich nucleosynthesis and the enrichment of the outer layers with heavy elements. More specifically, for stars with M$ \geq 4M_{\odot}$, the convective envelope can penetrate down into the helium rich layers, dredging up He- and N-rich material. The late AGB phase is characterized by strong mass loss, that eventually removes the stellar envelopes, leaving behind a degenerate C-O core as the central star of a planetary nebula\citep{pols2011stellar}. For a more in depth description of the MS and post-MS evolution I direct the reader to \cite{pols2011stellar}.


\begin{comment}
For stars with $M \geq 12$M$_{\odot}$, helium ignites before the effective temperature has dropped to a few thousand Kelvin. The stellar tracks for stars of less than $12$M$_{\odot}$ form a loop on the HR-diagram during helium burning, also known as the horizontal branch. The loop is accompanied by a drop and increase in the stellar radius. As the blazing front advances from the core to a shell enclosing the core, the star's outer layers expand again, and the evolution continues.

\subsection{Stellar Winds}\label{sub:winds}

Stellar winds play an important role in stellar evolution because they cause mass and angular momentum loss from the star. Even though they are fundamental in understanding the formation and evolution of stars, the stellar wind mechanisms involved are not well understood in many cases. Hence $\dot{M}$ is frequently quite uncertain introducing significant uncertainties in the evolution of stars. Driven by observations and theoretical models, stellar winds are usually categorized in hot and cold winds because they are generated by different mechanisms. Numerous mass-loss rate prescriptions have been proposed, with $\dot{M}$ varying in different parts of the HR diagram.

Hot, luminous stars (mostly OB-type MS stars and blue supergiants, BSG) experience a stellar wind driven by radiation. Radiation pressure causes an outward acceleration at frequencies corresponding to absorption lines in the spectrum, where the interaction between photons and matter is strong. Because it is primarily the lines of the heavier elements that contribute to line driving, radiation-driven mass-loss is dependent also on metallicity \citep{vink2001mass}. Mass loss due to hot winds is relatively unimportant for intermediate-mass stars.

During the final stages of evolution on the AGB, low- and intermediate-mass stars experience significant mass-loss, which removes the remaining envelope, leaving only C-O white dwarfs as their final remnants \citep{marigo2007evolution, pols2011stellar}. Cool, luminous red supergiants (RSG) produce a stellar wind, which is likely caused by a combination of stellar pulsations and radiation pressure on dust particles that accumulate in the cool outer atmosphere, similarly with AGB stars. Because there are no theoretical predictions, empirical formulas that fit the average observed mass-loss rates of stars of roughly solar metallicity are used in theoretical studies. For example, Reimers' mass-loss empirical formula \citep{reimers1975circumstellar} is commonly used to model the mass-loss on the RGB:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reimer}
    \dot{M}_{R} = -4 \times 10^{-13} \eta 
    \frac{L}{L_{\odot}}  \frac{R}{R_{\odot}} \frac{M_{\odot}}{M},
    \text{ M${\odot}$/yr}
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is parameter of the order of unity. On the AGB where dust formation becomes important, Blocker's mass-loss empirical formula \citep{bloecker1995stellarI,bloecker1995stellarII} is commonly used:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:blocker}
    \dot{M}_{Bl} = -4.83 \times 10^{-9} M^{-2.1} L^{2.7} \dot{M}_{R},
    \text{ M${\odot}$/yr}
\end{equation}
Other mass-loss prescriptions that are common in theoretical studies are \cite{de1988mass,nieuwenhuijzen1990parametrization}. The high mass-loss rate during the AGB phase defines both the maximum luminosity that a low- or intermediate-mass star may achieve on the AGB, and its ultimate mass, i.e. the mass of the white-dwarf remnant.

\begin{comment}

On the other hand, for masses greater than 15 M$_{\odot}$, mass-loss by stellar winds becomes important during all evolution phases, including the main sequence. Observations in the ultraviolet and infrared spectrum show that these luminous massive stars experience rapid mass outflows (stellar winds) that can gradually erode their outer layers. For masses greater than 30 M$_{\odot}$, the mass-loss rates, $\dot{M}$, are so great that the mass-loss timescale, $t_{ml} = M / \dot{M}$, becomes shorter than the nuclear timescale, $t_{nuc}$.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Internal Mixing}\label{sub:mixing}

Even though the overall stellar evolution is only slightly affected by the initial chemical composition, a variety of internal mixing process can impact the life cycle, particularly of massive ($M>8$ M$_{\odot}$), stars \citep{langer2012presupernova}. Apart from convection, convective overshooting, semiconvection, and rotationally induced mixing are the most important internal mixing process \citep{schootemeijer2019constraining} and are still poorly understood. 

\subsubsection{Convection}

Nuclear reactions at a star's core generate energy,
which is transported to the stellar surface, on roughly thermal timescale, see Eq. \eqref{eq:thermal_timsecale}, preserving the TE of the star. As a result, an energy density gradient exists, resulting in a net energy flux towards the stellar surface. Since an energy density gradient is associated with a temperature gradient, the more the luminosity to be transported, the greater the temperature gradient required. However, there is an upper limit to the temperature gradient inside a star; This limit is called adiabatic temperature gradient
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ad_tempe_grad}
    \nabla_{ad} = \left ( \frac{d logT}{d logP} \right)_{ad} 
\end{equation}
and describes the logarithmic variation of temperature under adiabatic compression or expansion. An adiabatic process occurs on such a short (dynamical) timescale that there is no heat exchange with the environment.

In the case that the temperature gradient limit is surpassed, gas instability, called Convection, occurs \citep{pols2011stellar}. Convection refers to the collective (bulk) cyclic movements of gas particles. This is a key activity in stellar interiors because it not only effectively transports energy but also results in fast mixing. Another important aspect of convection is that the energy transportation and mixing occur on local dynamical timescale $t_{conv}$, where $t_{conv} << t_{KH}$. This means that, while convection can efficiently transfer a large amount of energy, it does so at a nearly constant effective temperature $T_{eff}$, indicating that the process is nearly adiabatic (see red giant branch Fig. \ref{fig:HR_evolution}). Unfortunately though, it remains one of the least known aspects of stellar physics.

From \cref{eq:ad_tempe_grad} one can see that the temperature stratification of a convective star can be described by a power law $T \propto P^{\nabla_{ad}}$, where $\nabla_{ad} = 0.4$ for an ideal gas \citep{pols2011stellar} (variations of $\nabla_{ad}$ in partial ionized zones have being ignored). Additionally, for an ideal gas, $P \propto \rho T$ and by combining the above one can easily see that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:adiabatic_eos}
    P \propto \rho^{5/3}
\end{equation}.
\cref{eq:adiabatic_eos} is of great importance. It corresponds to a polytrope of $n = \frac{3}{2}$, where $\gamma = 1+ \frac{1}{n}$ and the absence of $T$ implies that the mechanical structure of convective stars or convective stellar envelopes is independent of the stellar temperature profile. 

\begin{comment}
Another important consequence of \cref{eq:adiabatic_eos} is
\begin{equation}\label{}
    R \propto M^{-1/3}
\end{equation}
which derives by combining \cref{eq:adiabatic_eos} with the equations of 
\end{comment}


{\bf Stability Against Convection}

Assuming that photons alone carry the produced energy, I define the dimensionless radiative temperature gradient:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:radia_tempe_grad}
    \nabla_{rad} = \left ( \frac{d logT}{d logP} \right)_{rad} = \frac{3}{16 \pi \alpha c G} \frac{\kappa l P}{m T^4}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ the radiation constant, $c$ the speed of light and $G$ the gravitational constant. The variable $l$ is the local luminosity, $\kappa$ the Rosseland mean opacity and $m$ the mass coordinate. Eq. \eqref{eq:radia_tempe_grad} describes the logarithmic variation of temperature with pressure, which represents the depth, for a star in HE if energy is transported only by radiation.

Using \eqref{eq:ad_tempe_grad}, \eqref{eq:radia_tempe_grad}  and assuming ideal gas, I derive the  Ledoux criterion,  which states that a stellar layer is stable against convection if:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Ledoux_criterion}
    \nabla_{rad} < \nabla_{rad} +  \nabla_{\mu}
\end{equation}
where $\nabla_{\mu}$ is the gradient of the mean molecular weight through the star. Hence, for chemically homogenius layers, the stability criterion against convection reduces to the Schwarzwild criterion:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Schwarzwild_criterion}
    \nabla_{rad} < \nabla_{ad}
\end{equation}

Because nuclear processes create more and more heavy elements in deeper layers, the mean molecular weight generally increases inwards. As a result, typically $\nabla_{\mu} \geq 0$, indicating that a composition gradient has a stabilizing effect according to the Ledoux criteria. 

{\bf Convection Occurrence}

Using \eqref{eq:radia_tempe_grad} and the Schwarzwild crietrion, \eqref{eq:Schwarzwild_criterion}, we expect convection to occur:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In opaque regions of the star, meaning $\kappa$ is large. Since the opacity increases with decreasing temperature \citep{pols2011stellar} we expect the envelopes of cool star to be convective. For example, low-mass stars or intermediate-mass stars during the RGB and AGB phase, see \cref{fig:HR_ROLF} and \cref{fig:HR_evolution}.
    \item In regions of the star with large energy flux, meaning $\frac{l}{m}$ is large. For example, the cores of intermediate- and high-mass stars, where nuclear reactions are driven by the CNO-cycle ($\epsilon_{CNO} \propto \rho_c T_{c}^{18})$.
\end{itemize}







{\bf Convective Overshooting}

Convective overshooting refers to the process of mixing beyond the boundaries of convective regions, which can occur when convective cells penetrate into radiative regions due to their non-zero velocity \citep{alongi1993evolutionary,brott2011rotating,schootemeijer2019constraining}. In stars with convective cores, e.g. intermediate and massive stars, the size of the core is effectively enlarged through mechanisms such as convective core overshooting. This overshooting brings additional hydrogen into the core of the star and therefore directly impacts the final He core mass and main-sequence (MS) lifetime as well as the evolution of the stars after the MS.

{\bf Semiconvection}

{\bf Rotationally Induced Mixing}
