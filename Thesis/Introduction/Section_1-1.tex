\section{Goal \& Scientific Questions}

In this thesis, I present the evolution of TIC 470710327 \citep{eisner2022planet}, a massive hierarchical triple system with a Roche lobe filling outer star. I use the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE, \cite{pelupessy2013astrophysical,portegies2018astrophysical}) to simulate the system's evolution and try to predict its future. Initially, I create stellar evolution models of the triple components until the tertiary fills its Roche lobe. I then simulate in detail the mass transfer for several orbits of the outer star using a combination of gravitational dynamics and hydrodynamics. 

There are two main scientific questions that I try to tackle:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How the mass transfer affects the orbital parameters of the two orbits?
    \item How the accretion of the binary affects the orbital parameters of the two orbits?
\end{itemize}

I examine the importance of various parameters, properties and type of mass transfer, the response of the inner and outer orbital parameters, and the consequent evolution.
