\section{Thesis Outline}
This thesis is structured as follows: 

In the second chapter, I present an overview of single massive star evolution until the end of helium burning phase with a focus on those aspects that are relevant for triple evolution. Furthermore, I discuss concepts of binary evolution and I argue how to extend these to the triple evolution case. In the remainder of this chapter, I provide information about the scientific codes utilized in my simulations. In chapter three, I introduce my target system. In the fourth chapter, I display the setup of my simulations, the underlying assumptions of my models, and their physical justification.
