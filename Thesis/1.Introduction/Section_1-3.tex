\section{Thesis Outline}

The remainder of this thesis is organized into four chapters. Each chapter starts with an introduction, while the chapters are structured as follows: 

In the second chapter, I present an overview of single star evolution with a focus on intermediate-mass stars, because this is the mass regime of interest for my target system. I also constrain myself in evolution aspects that are relevant for my hydrodynamical models. Furthermore, I discuss concepts of binary evolution and I argue how to extend these to the triple evolution case. In the remainder of the second chapter, I provide information about the scientific codes utilize in my simulations. In chapter three, I display the methods used to build my hydrodynamical models, their underlying assumptions and their physical justification. Furthermore, I present the initial setup of my simulations. In chapter four, I demonstrate my results, while a detailed discuss follows in chapter five.
