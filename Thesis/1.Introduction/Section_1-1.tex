\section{Goal \& scientific questions}\label{sec:goal}

In this thesis, I investigate the case of a hierarchical triple system in which the tertiary star will eventually overflow its Roche lobe before any of the inner stars leave the main sequence. The goal is to thoroughly examine the mass transfer phase by creating detailed hydrodynamical simulations and try to evaluate how does mass transfer affect the evolution of the inner and outer orbital parameters. More specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the impact of accretion on the system's evolution?
    \item What is the impact of different initial mutual inclination between the two orbits on system's the evolution?
\end{itemize}
