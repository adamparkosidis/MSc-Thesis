\section{Goal \& Scientific Questions}

In this thesis, I investigate the case of a hierarchical triple system in which the tertiary star will eventually overflow its Roche lobe before any of the inner stars leave the main sequence. The goal is to thoroughly examine the mass transfer phase by creating detailed hydrodynamical simulations, evaluate the significance of initial orbital parameters in the process, such as mutual inclination between the two orbits, and speculate on the resulting evolution.

There are two main scientific questions that I try to tackle:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How does mass transfer affect the evolution of the inner and outer orbital parameters?
    \item How does the binary's accretion affect the evolution of the inner and outer orbital parameters?
\end{itemize}
