In order to simulate the evolution of hierarchical triple-star systems with a  Roche-lobe-filling outer star, various physical processes, such as stellar evolution, gravitational dynamics, and hydrodynamics needs to be considered. First, I employ the stellar evolution code MESA \citep{paxton2010modules,paxton2013modules,paxton2015modules,paxton2019modules} to model the evolution of the system's stars prior to outer stars' \ac{rlof}. Once the outer star reaches the stage where it approximately fills its Roche lobe, I pause the stellar evolution simulation and convert the one-dimensional stellar structure into a three-dimensional hydrodynamical model. This 3D hydrodynamical model of the outer star is then relaxed, using GADGET-2 \citep{springel2005cosmological}, and placed in orbit around the binary star. The inner binary components are seen as point masses and their gravitational dynamics are handled by Huayno \citep{pelupessy2012n}. Subsequently, I monitor the intricate hydrodynamics of the mass transfer from the Roche lobe-filling outer star to the inner binary for multiple orbits, while simultaneously keeping track of the three stars gravitational dynamics and the outer star gas hydrodynamics. In this chapter I present in detail all the aforementioned steps. In each step I discuss the exploration of different parameters, the underlying assumptions of the models and their physical justification.
