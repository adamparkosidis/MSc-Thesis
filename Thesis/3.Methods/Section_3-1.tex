\section{Stellar evolution}\label{sec:stellar_evolution}

The stellar evolution calculations in this work are performed using the normal AMUSE parameters for MESA, with solar metallicity as the input.
MESA allows me to track the independent evolution of the triple system components and obtain estimations of their properties at the beginning of \ac{rlof}. In this work, I allow the three stars of the system to evolve until the tertiary overfill it's Roche lobe, such as $R_{stop} = 1.1 \times R_{L}$, see \cref{eq:roche_lobe}. The consequence of this choice will be discussed in detail in \cref{simulations}.

By the time the outer star approaches the radius of its Roche lobe, all three stars have lost some mass via stellar winds, while the tertiary's radius is much bigger than when it was formed. In order to accurately evaluate the Roche lobe sizes, I need to estimate the masses of the stars at the \ac{rlof} moment. Unfortunately, $\xi$ Tau's age is not known, but mass-loss via winds during the main sequence is expected to be unimportant for low- and intermediate- mass stars, see \cref{sub:winds}.

Despite that, I track the evolution of the tertiary's mass and radius profile. As expected, radiation-driven mass-loss proved negligible in this mass regime. For cold winds, I utilize Reimer's, see \cref{eq:reimer}, and Blocker's, see \cref{eq:blocker}, mass-loss prescriptions using commonly used scaling factors of $\eta = 0.5$ and $\eta = 0.1$, respectively.

\end{figure}
The tertiary loses less than $1\%$ of its 
initial mass, while the expected mass-loss from the binary components is even smaller, because less massive, and thus less luminus, stars will have weaker winds. As a result, I do not correct for mass-loss and use the parameters listed in  \cref{tab:system_orbit_param}.  

At this point, I also assume that the mass lost through winds has no effect on the stars. This assumption would be false in the case of more massive stars. As mass escapes from the star's surface, it carries angular momentum and can change the inner and outer orbital parameters. Furthermore, some of the escaped mass can be accreted, complicating the evolution of the two orbits even further. Given the small amount of mass loss, the aforementioned assumption is safe in this case.

In \cref{fig:HR_ROLF}, I present the evolution of the tertiary on the \ac{hrd} until the moment of \ac{rlof} and in \cref{tab:tertiary_param_ROLF} I summarize the tertiary's important stellar parameters.

I calculate the track using MESA \citep{paxton2010modules,paxton2013modules,paxton2015modules,paxton2019modules}.

The tertiary overflows its Roche lobe during the early \ac{agb} phase, see \cref{fig:HR_ROLF}, after helium exhaustion, leading to a type C mass transfer. \cref{fig:HR_ROLF} shows that when \ac{rlof} occurs, $T_{eff} < 10^{3.7} K$. For such low temperature the envelope's opacity can be high enough so that that the later will be unstable against convection, see \cref{sec:convection}. 

I present a Kippenhahn diagram of the tertiary, see \cref{fig:kippen_plot}. This diagram displays the structural evolution of the star from the core to the photosphere. The vertical axis represents the position within the star in terms of enclosed mass and the horizontal axis represents the number of the models, which are translated to stellar age (hence the x-axis is not linear). In this diagram, one can see how different regions are discerned: The white parts are the radiative regions, the stripped parts represent the convective regions, and the variation of the color represent the intensity of the energy generation at various regions in arbitrary units. Darker color indicate that more energy is produced.

\cref{fig:kippen_plot} shows that at the moment of \ac{rlof}, the convective envelope has penetrated deep inside the star close to the actual core. Hence, convective mixing is expected to enrich the outer layers of the star with metal-rich material. Additionally, in this case, convection defines the mechanical structure of the envelope. This is critical for the 3D hydrodynamical model and it is discussed in detail in \cref{sec:1D_to_3D}. 

Given the parameters in \cref{tab:tertiary_param_ROLF}, I also calculate the relevant characteristic timescales of the tertiary, see \cref{sec:timescales}, which are listed in \cref{tab:tertiary_timescale_ROLF}.

Note that the default parameters of MESA withing AMUSE do not include overshooting. However, I perform one test taking into account overshooting with $f=0.016$ \citep{herwig2000evolution}. On the one hand, the \ac{ms} lifetime extends, \ac{rlof} occurs $~10Myr$ later in the evolution, while the stellar core is more massive. On the other hand, the impact on the structure of the envelope's outer layers at the moment of \ac{rlof} is negligible. This is the region of highest interest for my mass transfer simulations, thus I proceed with models without overshooting. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that for $f=0.016$, \ac{rlof} occurs before helium exhaustion leading to a type B mass transfer.
