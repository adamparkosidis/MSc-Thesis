In order to model the evolution of outer RLOF triple-star systems, various physical processes, such as stellar evolution, gravitational dynamics, and hydrodynamics need to be considered. I utilize the Astrophysical Multi-purpose Software Environment (AMUSE, \cite{portegies2018astrophysical}), a comprehensive computational tool, to accurately simulate and solve for these physical processes in a self-consistent manner. To model the evolution of the system's stars prior to outer stars' RLOF, I employ the stellar evolution code MESA \citep{paxton2010modules,paxton2013modules,paxton2015modules,paxton2019modules}. Once the outer star reached the stage where it approximately filled its Roche lobe, I pause the stellar evolution simulation and convert the one-dimensional stellar structure into a three-dimensional hydrodynamical model. This hydrodynamical model of the outer star is then relaxed, using Gadget-2 \citep{springel2005cosmological}, and placed in orbit around the binary star. The inner binary components are seeing as point masses and their gravitational dynamics are handled by Huayno \citep{pelupessy2012n}. Subsequently, I monitor the intricate hydrodynamics of the mass transfer from the Roche lobe-filling outer star to the inner binary for multiple orbits, while simultaneously keeping track of the three stars gravitational dynamics and the outer star gas hydrodynamics. A schematic representation of the entire process is provided in
