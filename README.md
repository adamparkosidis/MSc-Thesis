# Mass Transfer in Hierarchical Triple Systems:
## The Case of Roche-Lobe filling Outer Star

This repository contains code from my master thesis.

## Abstract

Mass transfer in hierarchical triple systems, and more specifically, RLOF by the outer star, is expected to be considerably different from mass transfer in an ordinary binary system. The mass cannot be simply accreted by the inner objects, but may instead form a circumbinary disk or be expelled via a slingshot effect due to the inner binary rotation. Stellar evolution, gravitational dynamics, and hydrodynamics all play important roles in the process. I create 3D hydrodynamical models of post main-sequence stars based on detailed 1D stellar evolution models using [AMUSE](https://amuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) . Additionally, I couple hydrodynamics with a high accuracy gravitational integrator and solve these physical processes in a self-consistent  manner. Hence, I simulate the phase of mass transfer in a hierarchical triple system in which the tertiary star will overfill its Roche lobe before any of the inner stars leave the main sequence.
