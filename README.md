## Introduction

This repository will contain documents, code, and analysis from my master thesis.


Despite the inherent rarity predicted by the initial mass function (IMF, see e.g. Chabrier [2005],
Dib and Basu [2018]), massive stars (M ≥ 8M⊙) play a key role in the evolution of the Uni-
verse. They are the main source of UV radiation and heavy elements. They serve as a signif-
icant source of mixing and turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies through a
combination of winds, outflows, expanding HII regions, and supernova explosions. Galactic dy-
namos are powered by turbulence in conjunction with differential rotation. Cosmic rays are ac-
celerated by the interaction of galactic magnetic fields and supernova shock fronts. The ISM is
primarily heated by cosmic rays, UV radiation, and the dissipation of turbulence, whereas it is
finally cooled by heavy metals present in dust, molecules, and in atomic/ionic form. Therefore,
massive stars have a significant impact on galaxies’ physical, chemical, and morphological struc-
ture (Kennicutt [2005]). However, the physical mechanisms behind the birth, development, and
demise of massive stars remain elusive in comparison with low-mass stars ([Zinnecker and Yorke,
2007]).
The fraction of systems with companions grows with mass ([Moe and Di Stefano, 2017]),
as a result massive stars are seldomly formed in isolation. In contrast, most of massive stars are
created in binary or higher order multiple systems with ∼ 50% of spectral type B stars be in
triples ([Moe and Di Stefano, 2017]. Stellar evolution in multiples in combination with gravi-
tational interactions, angular momentum exchange, mass transfer, intense outflows and winds,
ionizing radiation, and supernovae affect the evolution of these systems and can result into ex-
otic end-products ([Sana et al., 2012, Toonen et al., 2016]). However, in many of these relatively
unusual objects that are difficult to be explained by binary evolution, triples provide promising
evolutionary pathways e.g. blue straglers (Winn et al. [2009]). Thus, a detailed examination of
the evolution of triples demands a self consistent treatment of three-body dynamics and stellar
evolution.
A very interesting system is TIC 470710327. This massive compact hierarchical triple sys-
tem, first discovered in data provided by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and
confirmed with the HERMES spectrograph, was published by [Eisner et al., 2022]. TIC 470710327
is made up of a massive main-sequence (MS) star on an orbit of 52.04 days and an inner cir-
cular binary of main-sequence stars with a period of 1.10 days. The tertiary star has a mass of
14.5–16M⊙, while the individual masses of the inner binary estimated of 6 − 7M⊙ and 5.5 −
6.3M⊙ respectively. The tertiary’s orbital arrangement is more complicated, with an eccentric-
ity of e = 0.3 and a mutual inclination of i = 16.8+4.2
−1.4 deg. Such a configuration of masses
is relatively rare ([de Vries et al., 2014]) and TIC 470710327’s genesis is still an open question.
One would anticipate that the more massive secondary star was the first to emerge since more
massive stars have shorter Kelvin-Helmholtz timeframes than stars with lower masses. [Vigna-

dynamics resulted in Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai (ZKL) oscillations triggering the merger of the more
massive binary either during late phases of star formation or several M yr after the zero-age
main sequence (ZAMS)
Apart from the genesis of the system, also its future evolution is unknown. The measured
mass ratio suggests that the 14–17M⊙ tertiary star, which will be the first star to develop off
the MS, will be the one to drive the system’s further evolution. It is predicted to fill its Roche
lobe and begin transferring mass to the inner binary. Although is currently dynamically sta-
ble, the outcome of such process is a strictly hydrodynamical problem ([de Vries et al., 2014])
and depends on the nature of the mass transfer and the response of the inner binary. If the com-
pactness of the inner binary is high enough a circumbinary disk may form. According to [Leigh
et al., 2020], such a situation favors evolution toward equal mass inner binary stars by causing
preferential accretion to the lowest mass component. On the other hand, friction may cause the
inner orbit to shrink if the mass transfer stream crosses it, which might result in a contact sys-
tem and/or a merger ([de Vries et al., 2014]). Due to the merger’s rejuvenating effects as well as
the accretion from the tertiary star, such a merger remnant may be regarded as a blue straggler.
In the case of a merger, the triple will be reduced to a new binary system opening a new discus-
sion about the possible fate of the system.
In this project, we propose the massive compact hierarchical triple system TIC 470710327
as our research target. We will use the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE,
[Portegies Zwart and McMillan, 2018]) to simulate the evolution the system and try to predict
its future. According to the Massive Star Catalog, this kind of mass transfer—from an outer
star to an inner binary—should take place in ∼ 1% of all triple systems ([de Vries et al., 2014],
[Hamers et al., 2022]). Hence, the examination of this extraordinary system promises new con-
straints on both the formation scenarios of multiple massive-star systems as well as their exotic
evolutionary end-products.
