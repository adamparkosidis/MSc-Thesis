<ins> Basic Points </ins> 

* Hierarchical triple means that the orbit of the tertiary ( $\alpha_{out}$ ) is much alrger than that of the inner binary ( $\alpha_{in}$ ) around the center of mass of the system.

* To define a triple system at least 10 variables needed. The masses of the inner binary components $m_1, m_2$ and the mass of the outer star $m_3$. The semi-major axis $\alpha$ , the eccentricity $e$ and the argument of pericenter $g$ of both the inner and the outer orbit. The the mutual inclination $i_{mut}$ between the two orbits and the longitudes of the ascending nodes $h$, which do not affect the intrinsic dynamical evolution.

* The orbital inner eccentricity $e_{in}$ and the mutual inclination $i_{mut}$ vary periodically due to the Lidov-Kozai mechanism, where $e_{in}$ = max when $i_{mut}$ = min.

* If the outer orbit is eccentric or if the stars in the inner binary have unequal masses the eccentic Lidov-Kozai mechanism can occur, which allows for a flip in the inclination such that the inner orbit flips from prograde to retrograde or vice versa.

Mardling and Aarseth stability criterion indicates that when the ratio of the semi-major axes of the outer and inner orbit decreases sufficiently, the system enters sta instability regime (instability means the escape of one of the components). The criterion holds for arbitrary masses and inner and outer eccentricities, although only for coplanar prograde motion.

$$ \frac{\alpha_{out}}{\alpha_{out}} < (\frac{\alpha_{out}}{\alpha_{out}})_{crit}$$
